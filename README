 Leekspin: An Onion Router descriptor generator
================================================

Leekspin (á la `the original internet masterpiece <http://leekspin.com/>`_ )
is a small tool for generating mock Onion Router (OR) descriptors such as
`those used by relays <https://metrics.torproject.org/formats.html#descriptortypes>`_,
`bridges <https://pythonhosted.org/bridgedb/descriptors.html>`_, and Hidden Services (HS)
within `Tor <https://www.torproject.org>`_ in order to convey information about said
relay/bridge/HS to the Tor directory authorities, the bridge authority, Tor
clients connecting to the network, and other relays within the network.

This tool is meant to be used to generate mock descriptors for testing or
fuzzing other Tor libraries and programs, such as
`Stem <https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git>`_,
`BridgeDB <https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git>`_, and
`Tor <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git>`.

The keys, hash digests, and signatures generated within these mock descriptors
are meant to be indistinguishable from those generated by real relays,
bridges, and Hidden Services within the Tor network.

Installing
==========

The very simplest way, if you use `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_ , would
be to do::

    $ pip install leekspin

Otherwise, the standard setuptools commands work just fine::

    $ git clone https://github.com/isislovecruft/leekspin.git
    $ cd leekspin
    $ python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt

Running
=======

Leekspin will install a script named… ``leekspin``. To use it to generate 20 bridge
descriptors, do::

    $ leekspin --bridge -n 20

And to generate 20 relay descriptors::

    $ leekspin --relay -n 20

And likewise to generate 20 hidden service descriptors, do::

    $ leekspin --hidden-service -n 20

Bugs
========

Should you decide to use this tool, and especially should you be so insane as
to try hacking on it, you will likely find bugs. You may find bugs in
Leekspin, BridgeDB, Stem, Tor's
`specifications <https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git>`_ , and possibly
even in Tor. Please, for math's sake! Report them! The Tor developers will love
you forever. You can
`report bugs on our issue tracker here <https://trac.torproject.org>`_ .

Otherwise, please contact `isis <mailto:isis circleA torproject tinycircle org>`.
